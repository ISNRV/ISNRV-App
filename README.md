# ISNRV-App

- Welcome to the ISNRV App, a project designed to serve the Islamic Society of New River Valley (ISNRV) in Blacksburg, VA. 

- Our app provides timely Azan and Iqama timings, along with the latest ISNRV announcements, and ISNRV catalog for Masjid Al-Ihsan.

- We are excited to announce several recent updates that improve the app's functionality and usability. We have fixed issues with different time zones outside the USA, added an ISNRV Catalog that includes images, links, and social media, and improved the user interface.

- We are committed to making the ISNRV App a valuable resource for the ISNRV community and welcome your feedback to further improve the app. 

- Thank you for using the ISNRV App.
